# My first React app using Material UI

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Why?
[Material UI](https://mui.com/) is an extremely useful library of React components that are ready to be used in your application. You can use those like Lego pieces to build beautiful interfaces. The components are ready to go and require minimal amounts of customisation. It saves a lot of development time and lets you hit the ground running. 


## How to use Material UI

Check out the [official documentation](https://mui.com/material-ui/getting-started/usage/) yourself.

## Installation

In the project directory, you can run:

`npm install` and `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.
